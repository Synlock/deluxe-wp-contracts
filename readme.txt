== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= What data is sent to the remote server? =
User ID, license key, and contract details (including company information, client information, etc.) are sent to the remote server for license verification and contract generation purposes.

= Is contract data stored on the remote server? =
No, contract details are only used to generate the contract and are never stored on the remote server.

= Can I use the plugin without the remote server? =
The core functionality relies on the remote server to generate the pdfs and contracts. Without it, the plugin will have limited functionality and will not be able to generate contracts.

= How do I customize the contract template? =
You can customize the contract template by navigating to the WP Contracts Menu in your WordPress Admin Page and selecting 'Create Contract Template' and setting up your settings. Here, you can edit the contract template to completely fit your needs.

= How is data security handled? =
All data sent to the remote server is encrypted in transit using HTTPS. Contract details are used solely for generating the contract and are immediately deleted afterward. User ID, license key, and tracking information are stored securely on the server.

= Can I store contracts locally? =
Yes, the plugin stores all generated contracts securely within your WorWPress installation. You can access stored contracts from the WP Contracts management pages.
